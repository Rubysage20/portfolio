            <h3>Skills and Education</h3>
            <p>During my pursuit of an Associate's degree in Information Technology, I developed a strong foundation in various technical skills, including network administration, database management, and cybersecurity principles. One of my proudest achievements was earning a certificate in programming, which equipped me with essential coding skills in languages such as Python, Java, and C++. These programming skills have enhanced my ability to solve complex problems and automate tasks efficiently. As I embark on my third year of pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I continue to deepen my understanding of advanced topics such as software development, algorithms, and data structures. I have also gained practical experience through hands-on projects, which have fostered my ability to work collaboratively in teams and apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. This ongoing education fuels my passion for technology and equips me with the tools necessary to contribute effectively in a dynamic work environment.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As an innovator, professional, and dedicated student, I hold an Associate's degree in Information Technology and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. With over 10 years of customer service experience, including 2 years in a supervisory role and 3 years as an administrative assistant, I have developed strong leadership and organizational skills. This portfolio serves as a testament to my passion for technology and my commitment to continuous learning. I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and interpersonal skills to make a meaningful impact in my future role. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work!</p>
          <p>During my pursuit of an Associate's degree in Information Technology, I developed a strong foundation in various technical skills, including network administration, database management, and cybersecurity principles. One of my proudest achievements was earning a certificate in programming, which equipped me with essential coding skills in languages such as Python, Java, and C++. These programming skills have enhanced my ability to solve complex problems and automate tasks efficiently.<p>
<p>As I embark on my third year of pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I continue to deepen my understanding of advanced topics such as software development, algorithms, and data structures. I have also gained practical experience through hands-on projects, which have fostered my ability to work collaboratively in teams and apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. This ongoing education fuels my passion for technology and equips me with the tools necessary to contribute effectively in a dynamic work environment.</p>
